# Unity Spray Pattern Generator ðŸ”«
Easily create weapon spray pattern for your game. Open up the project in Unity and enjoy.

I got a working recoil system, but i dont want to tweak the array values for like 30 Weapons manually. I cant find anythink online, so i created a small but usefull Recoil Pattern Generator.

# Get rid of tweaking values manually. Create your Spray-Pattern with simple Mouse Clicks.

# Write the pattern directly into a Vector3 Array
